Crud to-do list app to teach myself PERN stack. Initial commit is based off me following the following LeetCode tutorial (https://youtu.be/X8gr-qA_JEs) but subsequent commits I have plans to add additional functionality for practice such as displaying current time/weather. 

Building this application has gotten me comfortable with React/Node interactions as well as more advanced React features such as useState, useEffect, and async api calls.
